## Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of 52,000 Spotify songs to understand the factors influencing song popularity on the platform. It was completed as a capstone project for the Principles of Data Science course.

## Dataset
The dataset (`spotify52kData.csv`) contains information on 52,000 songs, including:
- Audio features (danceability, energy, loudness, etc.)
- Metadata (artist, album, track name)
- Popularity scores

## Project Structure
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Predictive Modeling
4. Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
5. Classification Tasks

## Key Findings
- No single audio feature strongly predicts song popularity
- Explicit songs tend to be more popular
- Strong correlation between energy and loudness
- Multiple principal components needed to explain data variance

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, sklearn

## Future Work
- Incorporate non-audio features (e.g., lyrics, artist popularity)
- Explore more advanced machine learning models
- Analyze temporal trends in song popularity
